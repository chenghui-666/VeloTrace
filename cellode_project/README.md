# pseudotimex

This package was auto-generated from the notebook `pseudotime_update3.ipynb`.

## How to install (developer/editable mode)

```bash
cd /path/to/pseudotimex_project
pip install -e .
```

Then in any script or notebook:

```python
from pseudotimex import get_top_gene_indices_per_cell, reduce_matrix_by_top_genes, plot_scatter_with_ode
# or import the module
import pseudotimex.my_functions as mf
```

Note: Review `mypackage/my_functions.py` after generation — some functions may reference notebook-level variables that need to be turned into parameters or moved into the module.
